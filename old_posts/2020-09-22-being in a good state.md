These days, I am preparing a paper about anesthesia and brain state. The main finding of the study is that there are multiple brain states even during a fixed concentration of anesthetic (and the other environmental conditions). Here, the brain state implies a period characterized by a specific neural activity pattern (i.e., a set of localized data points in a feature space). As there are many brain states like NREM and REM and their transitions in natural sleep, so are in anesthesia. 

For the last few days, I was being very lazy, lethargic, and passive. I slept and woke up late. I didn’t want to do anything. I don't know why. May be because of the long trip I had. I might be physically in a bad condition. Maybe I watched the series "walking dead" too much, and that affected my mental and behavioral condition. Well, I was in a "bad state" (not a brain state, more general sense). Most importantly, I do know I should get out of being lazy and lethargic state, but it was very hard to do. It is very hard to get out of the state once you are in it.

Let me have another example. When I visited my parent's home, I used to play with the cute little puppy, a two-month old, white mixed breed dog. She was very energetic and really likes to play with me. Like other puppies of that age, she often bit my hand or ankle. Well, it wasn't that painful in most times, but it was when she was too excited. When it happened, I tried to stop her. But no methods, being kind or being strict, worked once she got excited. This is because, once she is in an "excited state", it is really hard to put her in a "calm state". But I do know she can be in a calm state. Whenever we did a long walk, she became so calm, the lovable face I like more.

Based on the above, I thought of the followings:

- Humans (and animals) have multiple states.
- A state is characterized by specific emotional mood, physical state (maybe by hormones and neurotransmitters), behaviors, and personality.
- As one can have multiple state, our can have different personalities (e.g., introvert can be talkative sometimes).
- A state can make a transition to another state spontaneously or by external perturbation.
- If one is in a state long time, that defines one’s personality.
- What is a good state that I want to be in?
- How to get out of a bad state and be in a good state? How to maintain my state?
