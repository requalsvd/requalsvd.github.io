I am a computational neuroscientist, analyzing and simulating multivariate time series data. My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of loss and recovery of consciousness and measuring the state and level of consciousness. My approach includes measuring information flow between biological time series data, graph theoretical analysis, nonlinear dynamics, and numerical simulations.
