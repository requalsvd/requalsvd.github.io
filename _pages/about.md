### Professional Profile
I am a computational neuroscientist, analyzing and modeling data such as neuronal spiking activity and EEG signals. I explore the differences between consciousness and unconsciousness in the perspective of information processing and neural network dynamics. I also have a project experience developing medical device.

### Research Interest
- Neural computation and information processing in conscious and unconscious states
- Application of information theoretic methods to neural data
- Algorithm development for brain monitoring system
