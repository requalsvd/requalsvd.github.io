I am a computational neuroscientist, analyzing and simulating multivariate time series data. My research focuses on understanding of the mechanism of loss and recovery of consciousness. I postulate that the conscious brain operates near a critical state, that is being at the boundary between order and disorder, and pharmacologically- and pathologically-perturbed brains would be far away from the critical state. My approach includes measuring statistical interdependency and information flow between brain signals (e.g., EEG, LFP, and spike trains), graph theoretical analysis, nonlinear dynamical methods, and modeling of the brain dynamics. I am also interested in measuring consciousness in anesthesia and sleep and from comatose patients. I developed an algorithm for monitoring consciousness and its clinical usefulness has been demonstrated.
