I am a computational neuroscientist, analyzing and simulating time series data. My research focuses on (1) understanding the mechanisms of loss of consciousness and (2) monitoring the state/level of consciousness. I collaborate with experimental neuroscientists, and analyze time series data obtained in normal conscious and unconscious conditions (anesthesia, disorders of consciousness, and sleep). My approach includes measuring statistical dependency between multivariate time series (functional connectivity), machine learning, signal processing, nonlinear dynamics, and numerical simulation.
