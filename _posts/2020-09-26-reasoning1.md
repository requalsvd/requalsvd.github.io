q1) If buring babies in fire is God's will, how will we guess or know what God would do? God could do very evil or good.
But we don't completely know.
He might do a good thing for athesists.
I don't understand how you can come to any conclusions about what God would do 
or what wouldn't do based on his properties.
If God is all good and all powerful and still lets babies burn to death in fires, maybe he is all good and all powerful and choose not to save us or chooses not to love us or one specific thing you said is that, for atheists, they are making a leap of faith, they are taking, risking something.
They are taking their life in their hands.

q2) Human right could be a result of evolutionary achievment.

q3) If God is the only basis for human right, then why is it that, at least in parts of the world
, we've seen a trend toward increasing secularism and increasing human rights at the same time?
