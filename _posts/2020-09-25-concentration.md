Humans are born to feel satisfaction when they concentrate on something.
We watch movies, go travel, talk with someone, play sports or games, read books, surf internet and so on. 
We, human beings intrinsically want to focus on something.
That¡¯s what our brain does.

We don¡¯t want to sit and do nothing.
We hate to be bored. And we like excitement, pleasure, and achievement.
Well, maybe sometimes we may feel like wanting to do nothing.
But soon we would soon be bored and see ourselves doing something.

It is like we all have our own cup that should be filled with something.
Something we can sense, feel, think, and react.
When the cup is empty, you get bored and will seek for something or sleep.

Yes, I agree that we all hate being bored and like to do something, whatever it is. 
But don¡¯t we want to do many things at a time? 
Yes, we often like multi-tasking.
This may be because, the thing you¡¯re doing is not enough to fill your cup.
You do more than one thing at a time so that the cup can be full.
If you do cleaning, you may want to listen to music or radio.
If you watch an easy video lecture, you would open another window and do something else.
Or if you play x2, then it will be less bored and your cup will be full.

So, everyone has their own cup that has to be filled.
What would you fill the cup with?
