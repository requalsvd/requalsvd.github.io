I found that the changing patterns in the US stock market are quite similar to spike activity of neural networks.

Cortical slices display synchronous spike activity, more specifically, slow oscillation when they are isolated from other brain areas.
Neurons fire (generating spike) and silent synchronously and the period is about 0.1 ~ 1 Hz.
The period of spikes is called UP-state and that of silence of spikes is called DOWN-state.
Originally UP/DOWN states are defined by voltage level of individual neurons, but I simplified...
The exact mechanism for slow oscillation is not known but one of strong candidates is related ATP dynamics, that is biological energy consumption/accumulation.
