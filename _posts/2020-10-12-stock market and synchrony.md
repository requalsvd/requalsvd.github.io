I found similar patterns between the US stock market and spike activity of neural networks. That is, a massive sell-off in the stock market and synchronous bursting spikes in neural networks.

It is not always the case, but the US stock price has been onwards and upwards. There were occasional massive sell-off, or economic crisis, but the overall price, or index price has increased so far. It increases slowly, but when it drops, due to the massive sell-off, the absolute value of the slope is much larger than that of the increases. (if you know this pattern, it is somewhat easy to earn some money at least higher than bank interest)

The similar collective behavior in neural networks I think is so-called slow oscillation; synchronous firing of neurons with a frequency range 0.1-1 Hz. During slow oscillation, neurons fire together and rest together. This can be easily seen in NREM sleep, general anesthesia, and some pathological conditions. Also, when a cortical slice is isolated, they display slow oscillation too. Some researchers postulate that slow oscillation is a default activity of neural networks. The period of massive spikes is called UP-state and the period of silence is called DOWN-state. During UP-state, due to the massive bursting spikes, synaptic resources and energy (ATP) are depleted. And during DOWN-state, the depleted synaptic resources and energy slowly recover such that at certain point, neurons can fire synchronously again.

The mechanism for this is thought to be excitatory feedback loop and limited resources along with the slow recovery of the resource dynamics. I guess a similar mechanism may govern the stock market too.
