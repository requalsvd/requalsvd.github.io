Many people say, "prove the existence of God, then I will believe God".
However, not believing God requires another belief.
It is not a default state.
Tim Keller said, being a humanist and not believing God require more belief and logical jump, than a person believing God.

Basically, we all believe something.
Our reasons, thoughts, and behaviors are all based on what we believe.
We build up something out of what we believe.
They are like building blocks.
