Many people say, "prove the existence of God, then I will believe God".
We all have ways to choose.
The thing is that all ways need a certain amount of belief.
Choosing not to believe God does not mean you are not relying on beliefs.

We all believe something.
Our reasons, thoughts, and behaviors are all based on what we believe.
We build up something out of what we believe.
They are like building blocks for reasoning.
