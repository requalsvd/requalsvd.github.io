Most real-world complex systems have a reverberant excitation and limited resources. And that’s why synchronization is so ubiquitous. Well… yes, synchrony is so common but there are cases without synchrony. Then why some systems do not show synchrony? Maybe…
1) Resources recover fast after activation.
2) Existence of random-like external input.
3) Absence or disturbance of negative/positive feedback
